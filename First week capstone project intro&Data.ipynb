            "source": "## Part I: Introduction &Business Understanding:-\n## A-Introduction \n### A-1 Background:-\nA multinational bank adopted expansion plan in Canada . We are a consulting company we were assigned a mission to prepare a feasibility study to determine the best locations in Toronto neighborhoods. Depending on our distinctive approach \u201c Mapping customers & competitors segmentation and clustering in neighborhoods  by using Foursquare  incorporation with needed  datasets by  Building  a Decision making Model to predict the best locations for new branches in Toronto neighborhoods.\n### A-2 Problem:- \nBoard of directors decided to open three new branches in Toronto neighborhoods. Upon  Bank policy bank target is  increasing retail savings and lending portfolios according to increase bank accounts, credit cards and consumer loans sales volume. We have to determine the best location for an automated bank branch and two retail bank branches. \n.\n## B-Business Understanding:-\n### Literature review:-\n#### Location:-\nis an area that acts as the primary retail core serving the neighborhood where it comes in many types:-  \n 1-Retail corridors with a string of small strip centers generally containing small neighborhood \u2013oriented retailers .  \n 2-Town centers or downtowns  ,especially in older cities in the northeast  often act as a community \u2018s focal  point.   \n 3-Community shopping centers generally anchored by a grocery store or national pharmacy surrounded by banks, restaurants and other retailing.   \n 4-Big box centers like home depot or target when one store dominates the parcel and may have many building pads or small strip centers on the outer edges.  \n 5-Regional malls with hundreds of stores.    \n#### Why determine the best locations & sites are critical?\n-Market conditions determine the overall opportunity and probability of selecting the right location which is highly important like selecting the market place. Once we have studied our market and identify neighborhood that has the right market conditions for a successful new branch we need to find the right location within that neighborhood.  \n-Success in determination the location grantee  how well you can serve that market by taking advantage of natural consumer shopping patterns on the other hand site quality will determine how visible and accessible you are to those people.   \n-Bank branches perform well when aligned with retail centers visited at similar frequency to bank visits on that way you are convenient to your customer\u2019s existing shopping patterns and not a stand-alone destination .This is the reason why community shopping centers with large grocery store anchor are the most favored locations.  \n-The right site refers to a specific building parcel at a location. You can have a great location in the right market but  choosing the wrong site at the location hurts the branch performance .You could try to imagine the site from a potential customers\u2019 perspective can they easily see it ? Does it have a good access can they go to it easily ? For example free stand buildings at hard corners are best as they offer visibility from both directions, free standing building in the shopping centers are the next best though they have no visibility from the two directions but they locates in the entrance and easy access as well .  \n#### Now the question is how much locations determination is impacting our marketing plan and bank ROA target? Here are some examples:  \n  -Locations lack significant retail focal point underperforms due to lack of convenience and draw impacting sales by as much as 20-30% .   \n  -Hard corner free- standing buildings generally perform best and by comparison branches that do not have these characteristics typically have 10-20%fewer sales .  \n  -In-store sites generally perform at only 25-35%of free \u2013standing traditional branches.  \n  -Take the time to get it right you are making a long term investment and when all things align success will follow.   \n#### What is the optimal criteria have to depend on in a  mapping approach to grant the best locator for a bank branches ?\nOnce we select a location depending on our Data Analysis where data tells us the highly performance locations then  it will be plotted in a map and  we will be able to  describe the advantages and disadvantage for each particular location and we will be able to determine the feasibility of our expansion plan , closing old branches  or transformation of branches depending on these criteria:-  \n1-Customers segmentations (lifestyle-behavior especially their consuming and purchase pattern). \n2-population &demographics (age \u2013gender-households).  \n3-financial indicator for each neighborhood.   \n-domestic per capita income.     \n-expected growth rate of deposits &loans performance.    \n4-Competitors segmentations.   \n5-Location of competitors branches.   \n6-Easiness to reach and  access.  \n7-Distance between branches.   \n8-Cost of opening a new branch.   \n9-Cost of closing existing branch.   \n10-Average transaction volume .  \n#### Why mapping approach is essential to define the best branches location?  \nUsing of mapping will help as to:-  \n1- Discover the targeted areas streets, roads, highways, landmarks.  \n2-distribution of ATMs and competitors\u2019 branches which give us a clear image about the branches concentration rate and feasibility of opening a branch at this neighborhoods.  \n3-a comprehensive picture about the area and its lifestyle nature  number of malls , restaurants , corporates concentration, groceries, parking, bus or metro stations to determine our target customers and their identifications  to understand their preference  to be able to determine our  service mix .and put  our effective marketing strategy reaching branch average transaction volume.  \n4- Determine the  shape and design of our selected sites .  \n#### How location selections decision will depend on mapping recommendations? here some examples:  \n1-For example if our target will be expansion in corporate portfolios  it will be recommended to open a branch in free zones area ,highly concentrated corporate area & financial and business area  according to our map locations pictures and analysis .  \n2-If our target will be expansion on SMEs and micro finance it will be recommended to open a branch in industries zones and areas   or in highly concentrated groceries and restaurants area .  \n3-If our target is  to expand our retails and consumer portfolios our target customer will be households  it will be recommended to choose area easily accessible and reachable near park area and bus or metro stations , we could open it near or in commercial malls or at commercial areas like downtowns or in highly populated areas.   \n\n4-If our target is to open automated branch  our customers will be millennium generation so it will be convenient to choose it near universities and clubs ,youth residence and cities .  \n5-If our target is to open sites for elite customers it will be recommended to choose high income areas with high standard of living style areas depending on our map we could locate neighborhood has a highly concentration of villas, palaces , diamond stores ,elite  clubs , mortgage brokers .  \n\nConsist Locational profiles of the existing customer base in the area under consideration  by segmenting and clustering neighborhoods technique .It is necessary in determining not only the optimum placement or modifications in branches and equipment but to determine the likelihood of financial success of branch and equipment under various scenarios .We can use foursquare as main player in determining our bank  branch  location feasibility study in corporation with some datasets to reach the optimal decision and help decision makers to put their convenient marketing  strategies and plans. \n#### Most of methodologies and approaches work in four dimensions:-\n##### Geographic:-\nWorking with popular mapping sites and software- for example  foursquare- to  link customer data to geographic areas to help improve branch locations , location analysis ,strategic planning ,product distribution ,competitors analysis ,target market and prospective customers profiling .\n\n##### Segmentation:-\nCreate a comprehensive picture of your customers according to shared demographics lifestyle and behavior patterns discover where they live and understanding their selling and purchase  performance to create more effective marketing strategy \n\n##### Location:-\nTarget consumers with precision ,analyze the competition and align service with the needs of community by  Create compelling maps for the streets and boundaries comes from industry leading data partners and includes points of interest , retail locations ,schools ,parks, bus stations ,restaurants, etc.\n\n\n##### Data Analysis objectives:-  \n1-Complete analysis of deposits growth  by category for all branches in the defined areas .  \n2-\tComplete analysis of the defined market place to determine penetration by all banks and ATMs, total available market potential within the perspective market area .savable and disposal income within the marketplace in general.  \n3-\tUtilizing the branch deposit & loans history projection program to establish actual branch performance as versus perceived performance.  \n4-\tGather information about the other competitors banks .  \n5-\tThe maximum capital expenditures for the establishment of branch and equipment needed .  \n6-\tThe type of customer base in each new branch .  \n7-\tThe relative weight of new markets in terms of being lending markets or saving markets or a combination .  \n8-\tDetermination of the convenient service mix for each new branch .   \n9-\tThe impact of various growth and expansion on the ROA of the bank.  \n10-Machine learning techniques in models evaluation .  \n\n##### The optimum Modeling will follow a multi criteria evaluation analysis starting with :-  \n1-defining the objective.  \n2-Identify and weights the criteria.  \n3-prepearing criterion maps.  \n4- designing weights to criteria, finally 5-implementing and evaluating our  predictive decision making model by using machine learning techniques.  \n#####  Modeling will depend on the following layers which will determine the specific  model criteria    :-  \n1-Population density layer.  \n2-Business center layer.  \n3-compatitive branch layer .  \n4-hotels and tourism center layer.  \n5-Hospitals and medicine center layers .  \n6-office and retailers layer .  \n7- income level layer .  \n8-Easience of reaching &entrance layer.  \n9-distance between branches layer .  \n##### Now we can set our evaluation criteria easily . Criteria will be weighted to determine our optimum target locations accounting on  classification approach as high, medium & low convenient then we will give them score as( 0.6, 0.4, 0 ).  \n1-population density zoning .  \n2-income level zoning .  \n3-cost of land purchasing .  \n4-office zoning .  \n5-retailers zoning.  \n5-parking zoning .  \n6-main street zoning.  \n7-competeitors bank branches zoning .  \n8-medicine centers zoning .   \n9-hotel and tourism location zoning .  \n10-Taxi and bus zoning .  \n11-Distance measure between branches and competitors branches .  \n##### Target will be to analyze each Neighborhood Data  scoring it and using Machine Learning techniques in  choosing the best classifier. Finally display the  clusters for each nominated neighborhood  on  maps- by foursquare and  by analyzing  clusters we will define the best locations.   \n\n# Part II Data Description:-\n## A:-Data Acquisition\nAs mentioned in the literature review section the type of data collected depend on the pre-set criteria which will be used in our model . The datasets is multivariate and attributes are real data  related to Toronto neighborhoods which consist of:-   \n1-Dataset for Toronto borough and neighborhood locations its attitudes and longitudes.  \n2-Dataset for Toronto neighborhoods geospatial data  .  \n3- Dataset for Toronto neighborhoods demographics includes numbers of populations distributed by age groups, origin, certification, employment status, apartment ownership ,average households income in each in excel format.  \n4- Dataset for Toronto neighborhoods average income level in excel format .  \n5-Dataset for Toronto neighborhoods education levels.  \n6-we will depend on foursquare API  to retrieve venues in nominated Toronto neighborhoods . Like banks, ATMs, restaurants, tourism locations, hospitals .  \n### Data Source:-\n1-Wikipedia (Toronto City).  \n2-City of Toronto Open data portal Home.  \n### Data Type:-\n1-EXCEL files for Main datasets .  \n2-CSV.file for Locations and geospatial data.  \n## B:Read Data:-\n-We use pandas library tool to read  Datasets in Data frames on our Jupyter Notebook on IBM Watson we import pandas and use pd.read_csv() functions.  \n -Main datasets in excel for simplification were merged  in one excel file and dropped any unneeded data columns and renamed file to be Toronto Neighbourhood Dataset on my PC and then dropped on my Jupyter Notebook to read it in pandas data frame.  \n## C:Data understanding:-\n### C:1Dataset size: 140 rows x columns23  \n### C:2Basic insight of Dataset:-\n1-Hood   :- Number of Neighbourhood  - int64.  \n2-Neighbourhood:- Name of each Toronto Neighbourhood-Object .               \n3-Pop2016:-number of population -int64 .  \n4-employed:-number of employed labour on each Neighbourhood - int64 .  \n5-unemployed:- number of unemployed labour on each Neighbourhood  -int64 .  \n6-Not in the labour force :- number of retired or non-able to work -int64 .  \n7-uneducated :-number of no educated still under education or out of education system- int64 .  \n8-college :-number of population certified from college - int64 .  \n9-educated  :-number of population certified and ready to join workforce-int64 .  \n10-households :-number of population represents households -int64 .  \n11-Owner:-number of population on each neighbourhoods has as ownership-int64 .  \n 12-Renter:-number of population in each neighborhood depend on mortgage rent- int64 .  \n13-households spending% :-spending as a percentage of average income -float64 .  \n14-income level :-household average income on each neighborhood- int64 .  \n15-dispairation of population from 20 years old to 64 years old which will  represents  prospected clients .   \n20 to 24 years               int64,\n25 to 29 years               int64,\n30 to 34 years               int64,\n35 to 39 years               int64,\n40 to 44 years               int64,\n50 to 54 years               int64,\n55 to 59 years               int64,\n55 years and over            int64,\n60 to 64 years               int64.\n\n## D:Data Wrangling\n1-No Missing values.  \n2-added one column named\" prospected clients\" by aggregating all distributed populations by age.    \n3-be sure that all data types is int64.  \n4-Binning:-rearrange data in (Pop 2016, income level ,prospecting clients, households, educated ,employed )in three bins high , low, medium and add a binned columns to the data frame.  \n5-indicator variables:- we will label binned categories as 0.6,0.4,0 By replacing high by 0.6&meduim by 0.4 finally low by 0.  \n### Now we could start our data analysis.\n\n# This is the end of my first week  two parts in our capstone project .\n# Thank you.\n\n\n\n"
